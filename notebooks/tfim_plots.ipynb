        "This post is a practical, minimal-yet-complete introduction to simulating the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with NetKet. We start by reproducing reference energies in 1D and 2D, then add long-range interactions and compare to exact diagonalization (ED) on small sizes, before scaling up to larger lattices. The code snippets are intentionally small and clean; each block is meant to be copied and run as-is with minor parameter tweaks.\n",
